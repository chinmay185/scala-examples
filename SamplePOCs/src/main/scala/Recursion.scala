Problems from the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"

1. How many different ways can we make change of $ 1.00, given half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies? More generally, can we write a procedure to compute the number of ways to change any given amount of money

2. Fibonacci series using recursion

3. Pascal's triangle using recursion

4. Recursive solution for computing nth power of a given number. Note that it's time complexity is O(n)

5. Modify above solution for O(log n to the base 2) complexity by simplifying the problem using the fact that if n is even, x raised to n = square of (x raised to n/2)

6. GCD of numbers using recursion

7. Finding Prime numbers by making use of probabilistic methods that use Fermat's Little theorem

8. Implement funcitons on lists such as length, reverse etc recursively using only plain functions like first, rest and empty?

9. Extend the above problem to implement higher order functions like map, reduce, filter, foldLeft, foldRight, flatMap etc using only plain functions.

10. Design a pairing problem for providing operations on interval based data types. For ex, an interval can be (4.5 + or - 10%) Provide operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc on such interval based types such that the result type is also interval based. (sicp.pdf page 99)

11. Recursive solution to typical matrices operations such as addition, subtraction, transpose, dot product, inverse etc.

12. Recursive solution to find out permutation and combinations of symbols. For ex, given a string "testing", write a program that computes all permutations and combinations of this input string.

13. Eight queens problem using recursion and its optimized solution. (sicp.pdf page 127)

14. Rat in a maze problem using recursion and backtracking.

15. Study the implementation of immutable persistent data structures in clojure like lists, sets, vectors, maps etc. and understand how their performance characteristics are met.

16, Implement operations such as union, intersection, contains, adjoin etc in context of sets using only plain functions. Consider the three implementation of set such as unordered sets, ordered sets, sets implemented as trees and analyze their performance characteristics.
